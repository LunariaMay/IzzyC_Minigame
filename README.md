Garden Defense
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some evil orb machine monsters found your garden and want to destroy it. Defend it! Shoot them down!

Controls: Use the arrow keys to move, and spacebar to shoot. 
How to Play: Shoot all of the machines that spawn! 

I designed the lives and score system, and made sure to allow for the 'death' of the machines when they're shot. I also designed the setting and assets used, using purely primitives shapes. What I did not make on my own was some researched code to allow the display of the DebugLog in the UI.
